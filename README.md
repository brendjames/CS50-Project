#Gun Crime Stats Of America

#### Description:
After hearing about the amount of gun crimes committed, I felt as though I needed to investigate for myself.
 
I firstly started off by asking questions,
1. Has gun crime always been so bad in the USA?
2. Is there any differences between genders and or age that can be used to identify trends?
3. Which are the top 3 states for these crimes.
4. Do the top 3 states match the top 3 cities?
 
From there I needed to find some real world data to look through.
I started with the History of Mass Shootings 1920 - 2022 that I found on Kaggle. 
After investigating that data set, I decided to construct various charts to understand the data a bit better.
Once I had written a python script to visualise the data, I decided to look at another data set to see if they come out with the same results.
 
#After investigating,I have come to the conclusion that:
 
An alarming number of shootings are happening now from previous years.
 
A sudden spike in 2014 and continued upward. And has no sign of slowing down.
 
The genders, in terms of victims, there are alot more male than female.
 
The top 2 cities correlate to the top 2 states, but the 3rd does not.
 
 
There are still many unanswered questions, like,
 
When will these mass shootings end?
When will more progressive laws be put in place?
Will it ever end?
 
People need not live in fear or safety for their lives.
 
Surely something needs to be done.
 
The USA is such a large country and has many,many resources.
 
Why are more funds not being allocated into the massive problem?
The gun laws need to change, to at least check if the person has a mental issue before purchasing a weapon
 
Joe Biden I'm looking at you!
