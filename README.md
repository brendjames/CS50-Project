#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/p2F35Q3JYjM
#### Description:
After hearing about the amount of gun crimes committed, I felt as though I needed to investigate for myself.

Questions I asked myself-
1. Have the gun crime always been so bad in the USA.
2. Is there any differences between genders and or age that can be used to identify trends.
3. Which are the top 3 states for these crimes.
4. Does the top 3 states match the top 3 cities.


#After investigating,I have come to the concultion that:

An alarming number of shootings are happening now from previous years.
A sudden spike in the 2014 and continued upward. And has no sign of slowing down.
The genders, in terms of victims, there are alot more male than female.
The top 2 cities correlate to the top 2 states, but the 3rd does not.

There are still many unanswered questions, like,
When will these mass shootings end.
When will there more progressive laws put in place.

People need to not live in fear.
